                <p class="text">Collaborating with roommates to do chores is challenging, especially when you don't know them very well. Currently, there is not an app to keep track of this, so people often use paper, google calendar, etc. An app will allow roommates to keep track of who did what, give notifications, and share statistics with the intention of equally dividing the effort of the different chores around their homes. This will allow users to remove the awkward tension of enforcing/reminding their roommates that they need to do their part. </p>

            <p class="text">Our target audience is college students who have roommates. These users have shared spaces and chores throughout their homes. </p>
            <li>What kind of chores do they feel need to be done in a shared apartment/stand-alone home? </li>
            <li>How do they evenly and equally divide the tasks that need to be done? </li>
            <li>Do they feel the tasks are all of equal value or do they think some chores are harder to do than others? </li>
            <li>Once chores are completed in the home how do roommates communicate that the chore has been completed? </li>
            <li>Is there a chore board that gets updated and what happens if a roommate forgets to mark it as completed? </li>
